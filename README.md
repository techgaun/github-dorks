# Github Dorks
[Github search](https://github.com/search) is quite powerful and useful feature and can be used to search sensitive data on the repositories. Collection of github dorks that can reveal sensitive personal and/or organizational information such as private keys, credentials, authentication tokens, etc. This list is supposed to be useful for assessing security and performing pen-testing of systems.

### GitHub Dork Search Tool
[github-dork.py](github-dork.py) is a simple python tool that can search through your repository or your organization/user repositories. Its not a perfect tool at the moment but provides a basic functionality to automate the search on your repositories against the dorks specified in text file.

#### Installation
This tool uses [github3.py](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py) to talk with GitHub Search API.

Clone this repository and run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Usage
```
GH_USER  - Environment variable to specify github user
GH_PWD   - Environment variable to specify password
GH_TOKEN - Environment variable to specify github token
GH_URL   - Environment variable to specify GitHub Enterprise base URL
```

Some example usages are listed below:

```shell
python github-dork.py -r techgaun/github-dorks                          # search single repo

python github-dork.py -u techgaun                                       # search all repos of user

python github-dork.py -u dev-nepal                                      # search all repos of an organization

GH_USER=techgaun GH_PWD=<mypass> python github-dork.py -u dev-nepal     # search as authenticated user

GH_TOKEN=<github_token> python github-dork.py -u dev-nepal              # search using auth token

GH_URL=https://github.example.com python github-dork.py -u dev-nepal    # search a GitHub Enterprise instance
```

#### Limitations

- Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. But, since this tool waits for the api rate limit to be reset (which is usually less than a minute), it can be slightly slow.
- Output formatting is not great. PR welcome
- ~~Handle rate limit and retry. PR welcome~~

### List of Dorks
I am not categorizing at the moment. Instead I am going to just the list of dorks with a description. Many of the dorks can be modified to make the search more specific or generic. You can see more options [here](https://github.com/search#search_cheatsheet_pane).
